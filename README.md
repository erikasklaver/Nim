# Nim
 * This creates the Nim class. This creates a number of "stones" from 10 to 20, which are filled ovals with their corresponding   * number labels. The object of the game is to remove the last stone before the computer does. Helpful text messages  * are displayed on the screen to indicate how the game is played. Only 1 or 2 stones may be removed at a time.
